Placing the Pt particle in the center of the Au prism (left) causes a net lowering of the dipole modes but no splitting. The lack of splitting is observed experimentally in the 0.99 eV mode map.

The gray shapes mark the positions of the prism and sphere. Interestingly, the low-energy dipole mode of Au+Pt has a large field in the junction, likely due to Au being a good plasmonic antenna, but the junction field is higher in Al+Pt at the dipole resonance of the Pt. This may be a signature of energy transfer in Al+Pt at these energies.}}{24}

For MNP radii $a\lesssim 7$ nm, the magnetic modes are ordered as predicted by quasistatic theory, with the NS mode (orange) lower in energy than the aN mode (blue). This implies that for small oligomers, the quasistatic approximation is accurate. However, at sizes $7\lesssim a\lesssim 20$ nm, the magnetic plasmon resonances switch spectral order. This is due to the relative strength of the far-field interaction (squares) in comparison to the near- and intermediate-field contributions (circles). Finally, for $a\gtrsim 20$ nm, the magnetic plasmon resonances switch order again. Also shown in panel a are the corresponding simulated resonance energies of each magnetic plasmon mode (dashed lines), indicating excellent agreement with the presented coupled-dipole model.}}{34}
